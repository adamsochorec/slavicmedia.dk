          It was the 12th of April when I woke up in the morning, grabbed my
          prepared backpack with lunch, and headed to Kolding train station. I
          took a train to Oksbøl, not far away from my final destination - the
          the westernmost point of Denmark, the city Blåvand (blue water).

          My original plan was to scout the local lighthouse, located
          approximately 35 minutes by walk from the bus station, out of the
          city. At that time in Blåvand held festival and a tiny main road
          cutting the city was jammed with cars, mostly from Denmark and
          Germany.<br />
          I bought a bakery with shrimp salad at a local fisherman's shop and
          started walking. Town's city centre isn't the largest, and soon you
          will enter an area with dozens of summerhouses with gardens, separated
          by beautiful pines. As soon as you approach the seashore, the vast
          recreation colony turns into alone standing houses, in the middle of
          dunes usually built a few meters from the sea.<br />

          Navigation states about 20 minutes of the route are remaining, after
          approaching the sea shore is time to turn a bit northern, to get along
          the 400km long west coast, which on the south meets the German border,
          and on the north, in Skagen, flows into the Baltic sea. Blåvandstrand,
          the westernmost point of Denmark, was filled with the sounds of waves
          blended with the screaming of seagulls and kids playing with old WWII
          bunkers, built during WWII as a part of the Atlantic Wall. I soon
          figure out that the bunkers are <i>standing</i> every few hundred
          meters, probably along the entire west shore. But
          <i>standing</i> isn't probably the right term. After more than a half
          of century without any maintenance in the sand right by the sea was
          too much of a deal, even for Hitler's engineers. The majority of the
          bunkers simply sink into the sand.

          Their exterior is usually covered by graffiti and some of them have
          additional Grotesk metal construction, shaping them like a horse or
          giraffe. As I pass several bunkers, occupied by screaming children,
          climbing up on the roof, hiding in the interior and former machine gun
          nests, I realize the point. WWII bunkers were built with the purpose
          to make killing people more efficient, with fewer losses, are now toys
          and playgrounds! The wraith spirit is gone, devaluated, and replaced
          by human creativity and the attitude of youths. It is hard to imagine
          something more embarrassing could happen to those constructions.

          As I pass more and more bunkers, each with a slightly different design
          and level of sickness, I got a funny idea to scan them. Better then
          any photo is a 3D model with detailed textures, that AR can project on
          a flat surface in a life-size. So far I have had quite a good
          experience with <b>Polycam</b>, scanning and processing options are
          not the most advanced ones, in many ways, it is just a black box. On
          the other hand, it is quite user-friendly and convenient to use. There
          are also several ways how to scan for free (creating user profiles,
          sharing scanned content etc.)

          I arrive at a sharp corner of the shore, where the lighthouse was
          built. In a tiny house, that probably used to serve the lighthouse's
          crew, I purchased a ticket to the top of the tower. The view feels
          surreal, the surrounding landscape looks like the planet Scarif,
          everywhere I look I see dunes covered by grass of blending colours,
          crossed by narrow paths.

          Back in the souvenir shop, I observe a significant amount of amber
          necklaces and jewellery being offered. The older lady behind the
          cashier's desk explains to me that with a bit of luck I can find some
          of those down on the beach.<br /><br />
          As I observe later when wandering along the west shore, the Danish
          Royal military likes to train in local stratified terrain and the
          surrounding of Blåvand is not an exception. The beach and sand fields
          towards the north-east accommodate several watchtowers (you can
          observe those on the left bottom corner of the panorama photo) and
          other facilities serving military purposes, such as antennas, small
          repositories, yellow signs announcing military areas as well as
          several other various models of bunkers.<br /><br />Blåvand lighthouse
          is reachable by car, with the possibility to park nearby the sight. I
          would also recommend visiting nearby Bjarke Ingels's
