# Slavic Media  

## Who?  
Developed by [Adam Sochorec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsochorec) as the first version of a landing page for the multimedia startup **Slavic Media**.  

## Why?  
Created to showcase the studio's portfolio, work, and clients while establishing a strong brand identity for Slavic Media. The website served as an introduction to our creative capabilities and professional services.  

## When?  
Developed over the course of **2023** and maintained until late **2024**, when Slavic Media transitioned to a modern **MEVN** stack ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/adamsochorec/slavic.media)).  

## What?  
A static website built as a **landing page** for Slavic Media, featuring:  
- **Portfolio showcase**  
- **Client work display**  
- **About section** to introduce the team and services  

## How?  
- Built using **pure HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and PHP**.  
- Despite being unopinionated, the code followed a structured approach similar to modern frameworks, including:  
  - **Reusable components**  
  - **Scoped CSS & CSS variables**  
  - **Manual routing** handled via `.htaccess`.  
- **External libraries** such as [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) were inserted directly into the DOM.  
- Core code was based on a previous portfolio project [adamsochorec.com](https://github.com/adamsochorec/adamsochorec.com).
